# Snake Game

Welcome to the Snake Game! This is a classic and addictive game where you control a snake and try to eat as much food as possible while avoiding collisions with walls and your own tail. Get ready for some nostalgic fun!

## How to Play

1. Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) on your keyboard to control the movement of the snake.
